                <div class="panel">
                    <p><b>Description:</b> A pair-based project to program a robot capable of navigating a virtual environment in a Gazebo (physics) simulation. Emphasis was placed on the robot's ability to recognize and read letters on signs. To do this, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN).</p>
                    <p>I implemented computer vision functionality, such as edge detection, color detection, and motion detection. I also worked with my partner to design a MVC GUI for testing purposes and to train a CNN for optical character recognition. The neural network was very consistent, correctly identifying letters over 99% of the time.</p>

                    <p>The robot is also able to drive autonomously thanks to its image processing capabilities (ability to detect road edges) and a PID control loop.</p>
                    
                    <p>At an end-of-term robot competition, my partner and I placed 3rd out of ~20 teams.</p>

                    <p>I programmed a PID control loop and a signal convolution script for IR detection using the STM32 microprocessor and Arduino. I also worked with electrical lab equipment (oscilloscopes, function generators, etc.) to analyze electrical circuits.</p>
                    <p>In terms of hands-on skills, I became experienced working with wire crimps, soldering irons, laser cutters, and 3D printers.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, our team's robot was able to drive significantly faster and more smoothly than most teams, and we were semi-finalists in a competition pitting all the robots against each other.</p>

I was a member of the Drafting sub-team from 2021 to 2023—in 2022, UBC placed 2nd at the Canadian National Steel Bridge Competition.</p>
                    <p>During my time with UBC Steel Bridge, I worked with Autodesk AutoCAD and Inventor to create 3D models and drawings for bridge parts, also utilizing Microsoft Excel to calculate distances and part sizes using trigonometric formulae. I was able to integrate into the team well and contributed actively to design discussions.</p>

                    <p>With UBC Orbit, I use our team's in-house Python physics simulation and my knowledge of kinematics and classical mechanics to help control the satellite's positioning. The project is very intricate, and I appreciate how everyone's work combines to form a whole that is more than the sum of its parts.</p>
